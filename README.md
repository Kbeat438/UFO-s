# UFO-s

# Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to make the UFO website more user friendly and allow them to sort the data based on certain criteria. 


# Results: 
To use the website you just enter the proper syntax (i.e. date: 1/10/2021, city:benton state:ar, country:us, shape:circle ) into the filter search field and the data should be changed to match your search 


# Summary: 
These design is useful to get the filtered data, the only draw back is that only one filter can be added at a time. For future development it might be beneficial to make it possible to use all the filters at once. With more data added it could also be useful to have the ability to just add 2 filters at once.

# UFO-s

# Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to make the UFO website more user friendly and allow them to sort the data based on certain criteria. 


# Results: 
To use the website you just enter the proper syntax (i.e. date: 1/10/2021, city:benton state:ar, country:us, shape:circle ) into the filter search field and the data should be changed to match your search 


# Summary: 
This design is useful to get the filtered data as long as you know exactly what information you are searching for. If you do not know what city you are looking for and are guessing by date or some other variable it might be hard to find the UFO sighting you are looking for. Also this filter is very sensitive. You need to put in the correct appreviation for a state for example and if you are wrong or have something capitilized, nothing will show up.
